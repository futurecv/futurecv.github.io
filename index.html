<p>
There has been rapid progress in the field of Computer Vision in recent times, both in terms of solutions to established problems and emergence of new areas. At such a pace, it is increasingly difficult, but all the more important, for individual researchers to take stock of the changing landscape and be thoughtful about research directions being pursued. The goal of this workshop is to bring together pioneers in the field and ask them to predict the direction of our field in the next five years -- what in their view would be areas where progress would be made, or important problems that would remain open. We hope that this should not only be an exciting topic of discussion, but also provide seedling ideas to young graduate students who are the driving force of research in our community.
</br><br>

<!-- The workshops often organized at CVPR/ECCV/ICCV provide excellent opportunities for discussions and presentations on a focused topic, often inviting researchers in that area to present their latest results. Our goal is to organize a complementary workshop which differs from these by focusing on the progress in the community more broadly, and having invited talks from researchers on speculative trends rather than submitted/accepted papers. We hope that this will provide an opportunity for broad discussions on projected research directions that are often not possible in focused workshops, and that young researchers would also greatly benefit from the discussions as they can make informed decisions on the main topic of their research.
</br><br>

As speakers, we have invited renowned researchers who work on diverse problems in the field of Computer Vision, as well as researchers who work at the growing intersection of vision with other fields (e.g. Graphics, Robotics, Machine Learning). We hope talks from these experienced researchers on a broad set of research topics will provide a holistic perspective about the changing landscape of the field.
